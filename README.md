Few datasets contain self-identified sensitive attributes, inferring attributes risks
introducing additional biases, and collecting attributes can carry legal risks. Besides,
categorical labels can fail to reflect the continuous nature of human phenotypic
diversity, making it difficult to compare the similarity between same-labeled faces.
To address these issues, we present A View From Somewhere (AVFS)â€”a dataset of
638,180 human judgments of face similarity. We demonstrate the utility of AVFS
for learning a continuous, low-dimensional embedding space aligned with human
perception. Our embedding space, induced under a novel conditional framework,
not only enables the accurate prediction of face similarity, but also provides a
human-interpretable decomposition of the dimensions used in the human decision-making 
process, and the importance distinct annotators place on each dimension.
We additionally show the practicality of the dimensions for collecting continuous
attributes, performing classification, and comparing dataset attribute disparities.

## Installation
The code was developed using `python=3.10`, `pytorch=1.11` 
and `torchvision=0.12` with CUDA support, as well as `cmake` and `dlib`.

Install A View From Somewhere:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:SonyResearch/A_View_From_Somewhere.git
cd a_view_from_somewhere
conda env create -f avfs.yaml
conda activate avfs
```

## Getting Started

First download A View From Somewhere [model checkpoints](#checkpoints). A model can be 
loaded as follows:

```python
from avfs.build_avfs import load_registered_model
model, annotator_labels = load_registered_model(model_name="avfs_cph")
```
Refer to the [example notebook](notebooks/avfs_model_example.ipynb) for details on 
how use A View From Somewhere models to obtain face embeddings.
